Google Compute Engine CodeLab
=== 

We start our codelab by an [interactive tutorial](https://console.cloud.google.com/start) hosted on GCE. There are bunch of ways in which we can deploy on GCE, and some of the links are posted in below section. We will explore GCE using Native method. However questions on other methods will be entertained. 


## There are different ways to deploy on GCE, some of them are   
1. Tools to deploy on google compute engine 
	+ [Native way](https://cs231n.github.io/gce-tutorial/)
	+ [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/guide_gce.html)
